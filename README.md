# Descriptive Statistics and Class/Static Properties and Methods in JavaScript

## Overview

This repository explores two core concepts in JavaScript:

Descriptive Statistics: Techniques for summarizing and understanding a dataset.
Class/Static Properties and Methods: Features for managing shared properties and behaviors within classes.
## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Explore the code in the directory.
Run examples using node src/<filename>.

## Descriptive Statistics

Key Concepts:

Measures of Central Tendency: Describe the "typical" value in a dataset.
Mean: The average value.
Median: The middle value when sorted.
Mode: The most frequent value.
Measures of Dispersion: Describe the spread of data.
Range: The difference between the largest and smallest values.
Variance: The average of squared deviations from the mean.
Standard Deviation: The square root of variance.
Interquartile Range (IQR): The range of the middle 50% of data.
Code Example:

```
class DescriptiveStatistics {
  // ... ()
}
```
## Class/Static Properties and Methods

Key Concepts:

Class Properties: Shared properties among all instances of a class.
Static Methods: Methods are called on the class itself, not on instances.
Code Example:

```
class Circle {
  // ... ()
}
```
Use Cases:

Accessing constants or shared data.
Utility functions are not tied to specific instances.
Implementing singleton patterns.
